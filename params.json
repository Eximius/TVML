You're free to use it for anything.\r\n\r\nDo give me a shout if you found it useful!\r\n\r\nWhy did I make this?\r\n====================\r\n\r\nBecause at some point I needed vector math support. Most libraries are either\r\nhuge or unwieldy, or both. This was written a long time ago, but only\r\nnow did I realize that it could save a lot of headaches for someone else too. \r\nThus, I made it open for all to use.\r\n\r\n\r\nLicensed under BSD 1-clause.\r\nA.K.A Leave the license in the source files, use it for whatever :)\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
