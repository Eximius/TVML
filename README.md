Tiny Vector Math Library

A C++11 Template Vector Math library built to be simple and effective.

Provides {2,3,4}D Vectors as well as Quarternions and Matrix{3x3,4x4}s

Supports CUDA and OpenGL shader naming conventions for usability.

You can check out how to use it in src/test.cpp, which does basic unit testing.

That's it. You're free to use it for anything.

Why did I make this?
====================

Because at some point I needed vector math support. Most libraries are either
huge or unwieldy, or both. This was written a long time ago, but only
now did I realize that it could save a lot of headaches for someone else too. 
Thus, I made it open for all to use.
